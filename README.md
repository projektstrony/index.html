# Spotv

An application to play songs on (panasonic) firefox os smart tv's using the spotify web api.

Import the app into the [App Manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager). Then you can run it in the simulator, or in a Firefox OS device.

Development on this project is frozen until the playback of full songs instead of their 30second previews through the spotify web api becomes available. This is announced to be added to the web api by spotify but has not yet arrived.
